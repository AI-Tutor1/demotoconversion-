# CLAUDE.md — Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Identity

You are working on the **Demo to Conversion Platform** for **Tuitional Education**, a tutoring company in Karachi, Pakistan. This tracks demo tutoring sessions through an 11-step pipeline.

## Stack — three layers, one repo, one deploy

| Layer | Directory | What it does |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Frontend | `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `middleware.ts` | Next.js 15 + React 19 + Supabase client |
| Backend (Phase 3, active) | `backend/` | FastAPI + LangGraph + Anthropic + Groq Whisper. Runs on `:8000`. Auth: ES256 JWT via JWKS (see `backend/app/auth.py`) |
| Database | `supabase/migrations/` | Postgres + RLS + Realtime + Auth. Migrations must be applied in order |

**These three layers ship together.** Frontend code that calls a Supabase RPC assumes the migration introducing it has been applied. Frontend code that hits a backend endpoint assumes the backend has been deployed with the matching handler. A PR that changes one without the others will break at runtime even if `npm run build` is green. See **Deploy Contract** below.

## The Four Laws — Non-Negotiable

Violating any one of these has crashed this project before.

### Law 1: Space Before Return
The JSX transpiler turns `return(` (no space) into `returnReact.createElement(…)` and crashes the whole app. Every `return` statement MUST have a space before the parenthesis:
```tsx
return (          // ✅ correct
  <div>…</div>
);
return(<div>…</div>);   // ❌ fatal
```
After every edit, run:
```bash
grep -rn 'return(' app/ components/ lib/ --include='*.tsx' --include='*.ts' | grep -v 'return (' | grep -v '//' | grep -v 'returnType'
```
Zero matches required.

### Law 2: No Hardcoded Chart Data
Every number in every chart, KPI card, leaderboard, or summary MUST be computed from the `demos` state array via `useMemo`. Analytics and Dashboard must always show consistent numbers. After every chart edit, run:
```bash
grep -rn 'const MONTHLY\|const ACCT_DATA\|const AGENT_DATA' app/ --include='*.tsx'
```
Zero matches required.

### Law 3: Muhammad, Not Zain
The third sales agent is **Muhammad**. "Zain" was wrong and was globally replaced. After every edit, run:
```bash
grep -rnE '"Zain"|'\''Zain'\''' app/ components/ lib/ --include='*.tsx' --include='*.ts'
```
Zero matches required.

The pattern matches a standalone quoted `"Zain"` / `'Zain'` string literal — that's how the bug originally manifested (`{ id: 3, name: "Zain" }` in the AGENTS array). It deliberately does **not** match legitimate teacher names that contain "Zain" as a substring (e.g. `"Syed Zain Ali Akbar"`, `"Zainab Fatima"` — added to the TEACHERS roster on 2026-04-14). The naive `grep 'Zain'` would false-positive on those.

### Law 4: Bracket Balance
After creating or editing any `.tsx` file, the naive `{}`/`()`/`[]` counts must each be zero.

### Running all four
Don't run the four greps by hand — they're codified in `scripts/_four-laws-check.sh`, which `scripts/smoke.sh` calls. See **Before You Commit** below.

## Deploy Contract

The three stack layers ship **in lockstep**:

```
1.  Apply migrations       supabase/migrations/ → DB
2.  Deploy backend         backend/   → :8000  (needs `cryptography`, `PyJWT`)
3.  Build + serve frontend app/ + lib/ → :3000 (reads from (1) and (2))
```

If step 3 references anything added in step 1 or 2, steps 1 + 2 MUST be deployed first. **An on-disk migration that has not been applied is a footgun** — the frontend `supabase.rpc('foo', …)` call passes TypeScript but 404s at runtime. This is what broke the UI on 2026-04-15 (see MEMORY.md `feedback_never_ship_unverified_integration.md`).

**The smoke script enforces this.** `scripts/smoke.sh` probes every `supabase.rpc()` called from frontend code against the live DB; it fails loudly if any called function isn't deployed.

## Before You Deploy — local `:3000` first, always

**Rule**: No change goes to Vercel / Render / the production domain until it has been verified end-to-end on `http://localhost:3000` against the live DB, as each relevant role.

Sequence, non-negotiable:

1. Apply migrations (`supabase/migrations/`) to the prod project.
2. `./scripts/smoke.sh` passes.
3. `npm run dev` on :3000 — walk the affected flows as analyst / manager / sales. Open the browser console; confirm zero errors. Confirm role-gated UI, realtime reactivity, and the obvious negative cases (missing data, wrong role, typos).
4. Only then push to `main`.

Build-green ≠ prod-ready. Full details + symptoms of past breakage in [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) and `memory/feedback_local_before_domain.md`.

## Before You Commit

**Single command:** `./scripts/smoke.sh`

It runs, in order:
1. Four Laws + bracket balance — `scripts/_four-laws-check.sh`
2. `npm run build` — zero TS errors, zero new warnings
3. Migration manifest — every RPC in frontend code exists in the DB
4. Backend contract — `POST /api/v1/demos/*/analyze` without auth returns 401
5. Dev server reachability — `/login` returns HTML (if dev is running)

A passing run ends with `✅ smoke passed`. Anything else blocks the commit.

For this to be automatic on every push, install the hook once per clone:
```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

**If you're touching code that calls a Supabase RPC, reads a new column, hits a new backend endpoint, or reads a new env var — the migration / deploy / env MUST be applied before the commit.** Do not ship on trust.

## Workflow for Every Task

```
UNDERSTAND → LOCATE → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → REPORT
```

1. **UNDERSTAND** — Read the relevant doc. Business logic → CONTEXT.md. UI → DESIGN.md. State → "How State Works" below.
2. **LOCATE** — Identify which files need to change. Check the File Roles table.
3. **PLAN** — State what you will change and why, before writing code. If touching `lib/store.tsx`, list every consumer that will be affected.
4. **IMPLEMENT** — Follow the Code Conventions section below.
5. **VERIFY** — `./scripts/smoke.sh` (runs Four Laws + build + migration manifest + backend contract). No other sequence.
6. **REPORT** — Summarize what changed and confirm the smoke passed.

## How State Works

All shared state lives in `lib/store.tsx` (React Context). Every page accesses it via `useStore()`:

```tsx
const {
  demos,             // Full demo array (source of truth, synced with Supabase)
  setDemos,          // Wrapped setter — diff + batched Supabase write + rollback
  rangedDemos,       // demos filtered by global date range
  approvedSessions,  // Approved product-review sessions joined to their scorecard (analyst/manager only)
  stats,           // Computed: { total, converted, pending, notConv, rate, avgR, pourRate }
  flash,           // flash("Message") — toast for 3.5s
  logActivity,     // logActivity("converted", "Maryam", "Ahmed Khan")
  setConfirm,      // setConfirm({ title, msg, onConfirm }) — confirm modal
  notifications,   // Computed: pending demos aged 3+ days
  dateRange, setDateRange,
  loading,         // True during initial fetch
  user,            // { id, email, role, full_name } | null
} = useStore();
```

### Data-model invariant — entities are loosely coupled

**A teacher can have demos with no sessions, sessions with no demos, both, or neither. Same for students.** The demo pipeline and the product-review (session) pipeline are independent data flows that happen to share the same humans. Any page, query, component, or aggregation that references teachers or students MUST:

- Never assume a teacher appears in `demos` just because they exist in `sessions` (and vice versa). The `/teachers` page learned this the hard way — its grid was built only from demos, so teachers with approved sessions but zero demos were unreachable. Fixed by unioning sources via the `TEACHERS` roster lookup ([app/teachers/page.tsx:23-44](app/teachers/page.tsx#L23-L44)).
- Build primary groupings from the **union** of all entity sources that can carry the teacher/student name, not from one source.
- Resolve a teacher's tid from name via the `TEACHERS` array in [lib/types.ts](lib/types.ts) when joining across `demos` ↔ `sessions` ↔ `enrollments` (different ID spaces — see `memory/project_session_to_profile_linkage.md`).
- Render empty-KPI cards gracefully for entities that exist in one source only — never crash, never silently hide.

The same invariant applies to the future `/students/[id]`: a student may have many sessions and zero demos, or vice versa.

### Store rules
- Pages use `rangedDemos` for display, `demos` only for mutations
- Never import Supabase in page components for DATA — all data goes through `useStore()`
- **Exception:** auth operations (`supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`, `supabase.auth.signOut`) are allowed to call `supabase` directly from `app/login/page.tsx` and `components/nav.tsx`. Auth is a session concern, not a data concern; the store's read/write/realtime machinery doesn't apply.
- Never init `useState` from a computed value depending on `demos` — use `useMemo`
- Every mutation to `setDemos` should be followed by `logActivity()` for audit

### Adding a new demo
```tsx
setDemos(prev => [{
  id: Date.now(), date: f.date, teacher: f.teacher, tid: t.uid,
  student: f.student, level, subject, pour: [], review: "",
  studentRaw: 7, analystRating: 0, status: "Pending" as const,
  suggestions: "", agent: "", comments: "", verbatim: "", acctType: "",
  link: "", recording: "", marketing: false, ts: Date.now(),
  workflowStage: "pending_sales",
}, ...prev]);
```

### Updating a demo
```tsx
setDemos(prev => prev.map(d =>
  d.id === id ? { ...d, status: "Converted", agent: "Maryam" } : d
));
```

The wrapped `setDemos` diffs prev vs next by id + reference equality, groups identical field-diffs for **batched `.in('id', [ids])` UPDATEs**, handles POUR changes via DELETE+INSERT, and rolls back local state on Supabase error.

## Data Model

Every `Demo` (see `lib/types.ts`):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `id` | `number` | Date.now() on client create; BIGINT in DB |
| `date` | `string` | ISO "YYYY-MM-DD" |
| `teacher` | `string` | Teacher full name (denormalized) |
| `tid` | `number` | Teacher user ID |
| `student` | `string` | Student full name |
| `level` | `string` | IGCSE, A Level, IB, … |
| `subject` | `string` | Mathematics, Physics, … |
| `pour` | `{cat, desc}[]` | DB columns are `category` / `description` — mapped in transforms |
| `review` | `string` | Qualitative review text |
| `methodology`, `engagement`, `improvement` | `string?` | Optional analyst fields |
| `studentRaw` | `number` | 0–10 |
| `analystRating` | `number` | 0–5 |
| `status` | `"Pending" \| "Converted" \| "Not Converted"` | Coarse state |
| `workflowStage` | `"new" \| "assigned" \| "under_review" \| "pending_sales" \| "contacted" \| "converted" \| "lost"` | Fine-grained pipeline stage; drives Kanban columns |
| `suggestions` | `string` | — |
| `agent` | `string` | Sales agent name (Phase-1 display; Phase-2+ uses `sales_agent_id` FK) |
| `comments`, `verbatim` | `string` | Sales inputs |
| `acctType` | `"Sales" \| "Product" \| "Consumer" \| ""` | Populated when Not Converted |
| `link` | `string` | Sales reference URL |
| `recording` | `string` | Recording URL set by analyst (Step 1 of pipeline) |
| `marketing` | `boolean` | Marketing lead flag |
| `ts` | `number` | ms-epoch timestamp for ordering |

### Lookup arrays (all in `lib/types.ts`)
- `TEACHERS` — 8 teachers with id, name, uid
- `LEVELS` — 13 academic levels
- `SUBJECTS` — 12 subjects
- `POUR_CATS` — 7 issue categories
- `AGENTS` — 3 sales agents: Maryam, Hoor, Muhammad
- `ACCT_TYPES` — Sales, Product, Consumer

## Design System (quick reference — full details in DESIGN.md)

Tokens in `lib/types.ts`:
- `BLUE` `#0071e3` — primary accent
- `NEAR_BLACK` `#1d1d1f` — body text
- `LIGHT_GRAY` `#f5f5f7` — section backgrounds
- `MUTED` `#86868b` — secondary text
- `CARD_DARK` `#1c1c1e` — dark cards

Primary CSS classes in `app/globals.css`: `.apple-input`, `.apple-select`, `.apple-textarea`, `.apple-checkbox`, `.pill`, `.pill-blue`, `.pill-outline`, `.pill-white`, `.demo-card`, `.kanban-card`, `.pour-tag`, `.section-label`, `.filter-select-dark`, `.filter-select-light`, `.nav-bar`, `.nav-link`, `.toast`, `.animate-fade-up`, `.animate-slide-in`.

Hybrid approach: CSS classes for reusable patterns (inputs, buttons, cards). Inline styles for layout (grid, flex, spacing). No Tailwind.

## Component Reference (`components/ui.tsx`)

```tsx
import { StatusBadge, Field, Stars, EmptyState, SectionHeader } from "@/components/ui";

<StatusBadge status="Pending" />
<Field label="Name *" error={errors.name}><input className="apple-input" /></Field>
<Stars value={4} onChange={setRating} />          // Interactive
<Stars value={4} readOnly onChange={() => {}} />  // Display only
<EmptyState text="No demos match filters" />
<SectionHeader num="01" title="Info" subtitle="…">{children}</SectionHeader>
```

## Page Pattern

Every page is `"use client"` in `app/[route]/page.tsx`:

```tsx
"use client";
import { useState, useMemo } from "react";
import { useStore } from "@/lib/store";
import { LIGHT_GRAY, MUTED, BLUE } from "@/lib/types";

export default function MyPage() {
  const { rangedDemos, setDemos, flash } = useStore();
  return (
    <>
      <section style={{ background: LIGHT_GRAY, paddingTop: 92, paddingBottom: 40 }}>
        <div className="animate-fade-up" style={{ maxWidth: 1100, margin: "0 auto", padding: "0 24px" }}>
          <p className="section-label">Category</p>
          <h1 style={{ fontSize: 40, fontWeight: 600, lineHeight: 1.1 }}>Page title.</h1>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section style={{ background: "#fff", padding: "40px 24px 80px" }}>
        {/* content */}
      </section>
    </>
  );
}
```

`paddingTop: 92` accounts for sticky nav (48px) + visual spacing.

## Code Conventions

### TypeScript
- Strict mode ON — no implicit any, no unused locals
- Type all exported function parameters and return values
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes, `type` for unions/intersections
- Use `Record<string, T>` instead of `{[key: string]: T}`

### Naming
- **Files**: kebab-case (`toast-confirm.tsx`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (`StatusBadge`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (`ageDays`, `formatMonth`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE for primitives (`BLUE`), PascalCase for arrays/objects (`TEACHERS`, `POUR_CATS`)
- **Props interfaces**: `ComponentNameProps`
- **State filter prefixes**: `f` (`fStatus`, `fTeacher`)
- **Sales form field bag**: `sf`

### React patterns
```tsx
// ✅ functional update
setDemos(prev => prev.map(d => d.id === id ? { ...d, status } : d));

// ❌ stale closure
setDemos([...demos, newDemo]);

// ✅ useMemo for derived values
const filtered = useMemo(() => demos.filter(d => d.status === fStatus), [demos, fStatus]);

// ✅ presence check on numbers
{items.length > 0 && <List />}

// ❌ renders "0" when empty
{items.length && <List />}
```

### Import order
```tsx
"use client";                                    // 1. Directive
import { useState, useMemo, useEffect } from "react";  // 2. React
import Link from "next/link";                           // 3. Next
import { useStore } from "@/lib/store";                 // 4. Local lib
import { StatusBadge } from "@/components/ui";          // 5. Components
import { TEACHERS, MUTED, BLUE } from "@/lib/types";    // 6. Types/constants
import { ageDays } from "@/lib/utils";                  // 7. Utilities
import { BarChart } from "recharts";                    // 8. Third-party
```

### CSS patterns
```tsx
// Responsive cards (KPIs, teacher cards)
gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(auto-fit, minmax(240px, 1fr))"
// Two-column form
gridTemplateColumns: "1fr 1fr"
// Master-detail (Sales queue + panel)
gridTemplateColumns: sel ? "minmax(0,380px) minmax(0,1fr)" : "1fr"
// Kanban (5 fixed)
gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(5, minmax(170px, 1fr))"
```

**Border radius scale** — `980px` pills, `16px` chart/modal cards, `14px` KPI/kanban columns, `12px` demo/kanban cards, `10px` inputs, `8px` inner boxes, `6px` small buttons, `4px` checkboxes.

**Section alternation** — `#000` hero → `LIGHT_GRAY` KPIs → `#fff` content → `LIGHT_GRAY` charts → `#000` leaderboard.

### File size
Keep pages ≤ 300 lines, shared components ≤ 200, library files ≤ 150. If a page exceeds, extract a sub-component into `components/`.

---

## Verification Scripts

Run after every edit before committing. Kept short — for deeper detail see `npm run build` which is the final gate.

```bash
# 1. Build — catches types, bundling, page registration
npm run build

# 2. Four Laws sweep
grep -rn 'return(' app/ components/ lib/ --include='*.tsx' --include='*.ts' | grep -v 'return (' | grep -v '//' | grep -v 'returnType'
grep -rn 'const MONTHLY\|const ACCT_DATA\|const AGENT_DATA' app/ --include='*.tsx'
grep -rn 'Zain' app/ components/ lib/ --include='*.tsx' --include='*.ts'

# 3. Bracket balance per changed file
for f in changed files; do
  node -e "const c=require('fs').readFileSync('$f','utf8');let b=0,p=0,k=0;for(const x of c){if(x==='{')b++;if(x==='}')b--;if(x==='(')p++;if(x===')')p--;if(x==='[')k++;if(x===']')k--;}console.log('$f',b,p,k);if(b||p||k)process.exit(1);"
done

# 4. Every page has "use client" + default export
for f in app/page.tsx app/*/page.tsx; do
  head -1 "$f" | grep -q '"use client"' || echo "MISSING use client: $f"
  grep -q 'export default' "$f" || echo "MISSING default export: $f"
done
```

---

## Testing Checklist

### Automated (must pass before commit)
1. `npm run build` → zero TS errors
2. Four Laws sweep → zero matches
3. Bracket balance → all zeros

### Manual (spot-check after UI changes)

**Dashboard** — KPIs match demo count; date range updates numbers; empty state text is role-aware (sales/analyst/manager).

**Analyst form** — required-field validation; POUR checkbox reveals description input; star keyboard support; submit guard prevents double-click; new demo appears once in Dashboard + Sales queue.

**Sales queue** — status filter; teacher/agent/sort dropdowns; select-all + bulk action; confirm modal on status change; detail panel shows analyst review + POUR + recording link + Step 10 accountability when Not Converted; auto-suggested accountability matches CONTEXT.md logic.

**Kanban** — cards in correct column based on `workflowStage` (NOT age/data-presence); drag-drop shows drop target + confirmation modal on Converted/Not Converted.

**Analytics** — all 5 charts have non-empty data; respond to global date range.

**Teachers** — cards show correct stats; drill-down chart uses actual dates on x-axis; close button dismisses.

**Nav** — role-filtered links (sales sees no "Analyst"); user-initial badge → dropdown → Sign out; search finds by student/teacher/subject; ESC closes search; notification dropdown closes on outside click.

**Realtime** — update a demo in one tab, watch it reflect in another tab within ~1s.

### Data integrity tests (sanity)
- Add a demo as analyst → appears once on Dashboard, Sales, Kanban, Analytics, Teachers
- Mark Converted → Dashboard rate updates, Kanban card moves, Analytics funnel increments, Teacher rate updates
- Set date range to 7d → all views reflect only last 7 days

---

## Do Not

- Do NOT use Tailwind classes — CSS + inline styles only
- Do NOT create separate CSS files per component — all CSS in `globals.css`
- Do NOT use `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` — state is Supabase + React Context
- Do NOT render `<Nav />` inside pages — it's in `layout.tsx`
- Do NOT use `"use server"` — backend runs as a separate FastAPI service at `:8000`; frontend talks to it over HTTP with `Authorization: Bearer <supabase-access-token>`
- Do NOT add new npm dependencies without explicit instruction
- Do NOT hardcode chart data — compute from `rangedDemos` via `useMemo`
- Do NOT use `return(` without a space (Law 1)
- Do NOT use the name "Zain" (Law 3)
- Do NOT put `async` on page components — they're client components
- Do NOT use `fetch()` or raw HTTP calls in pages — go through `useStore()`
- Do NOT modify `lib/store.tsx` without listing every consumer first
- Do NOT add a second accent color — Apple Blue is the only one
- Do NOT add gradients or decorative shadows — the design is intentionally flat
- Do NOT run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is running — causes `.next` cache corruption (see MEMORY.md BUG-012). Stop dev first, build, then restart dev.
- Do NOT create additional root-level directories for services — only `backend/` and `supabase/` exist alongside the Next.js app
- Do NOT import from `backend/` in frontend code or vice versa — they communicate via HTTP only
